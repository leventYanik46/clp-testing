## Bringing Your Family to the US and the Immigration Process

 

### 1. Sibling Petition  

*  Petitions to bring a sibling to the US can take 8–15 years.  
*  People often don't apply because of the long wait, but nothing will progress if no application is made.  

Example: If you apply at age 35, you can get a Green Card at age 50. Still, it's a valuable opportunity, even if it's late. 

 

### 2. DV Lottery (Green Card by Lottery) 

* One of the fastest and most sought-after methods. 
* Applications can only be submitted during specific dates.  
* If not approved by September 30, the right is lost, and you have to start from scratch the following year. 
*  Waiting or delaying causes loss; if necessary, a “mandamus lawsuit” should be filed.

### 3. Errors in Form I-130 and Green Card Applications 

*  The section on the form asking “Will the application be made inside or outside the US?” is very critical. Incorrect marking causes major problems.  
* All children (wherever they are) must be listed in the application. Omitting them causes serious problems. 
* Information must be entered completely and correctly. 

 

### 4. Visa Center and Delays 

* If the file receives “documentarily qualified” approval (all documents and fees complete), the waiting period for the interview begins.  
*  If the wait exceeds 6 months, it is necessary to seek help from a lawyer. 

 

### 5. Citizenship (Naturalization) 

To become a U.S. citizen: 

* You must be 18 years old, 
*  You must have held a Green Card for at least 5 years (you can also apply after 4 years, 9 months, and 1 day).  

 

### 6. Parent Sponsorship  

* U.S. citizen parent can sponsor their child (even if over 21 years old) to come to the U.S., but the process takes a long time.  
*  It is also possible for a U.S. citizen to bring their mother to the U.S., which generally takes 1.5 years.  

 

### 7. Birth Abroad for Children  

If the child of a U.S. citizen is born outside the U.S.:  

* If the conditions are met, the child can become a U.S. citizen directly through the Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA).  
*  f the conditions are not met, an I-130 application is filed for the child.

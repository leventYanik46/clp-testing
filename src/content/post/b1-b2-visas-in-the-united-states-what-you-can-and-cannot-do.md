### **B1/B2 Visas in the United States: What You Can and Cannot Do** 

Traveling to the United States under a **B1/B2 visa** can open many opportunities, but it also comes with clear limitations. At **Capitol Law Partners**, we often receive questions from clients about what activities are legally permitted on these visas and which ones may cause immigration issues. Below, we break it down for you in a practical, easy-to-understand way. 

### **What You Can Do with a B1/B2 Visa** 

A **B1 visa** is designed for **business-related activities**, while a **B2 visa** covers **tourism and personal visits**. Commonly allowed activities include: 

* **Business (B1):** Attending meetings, negotiating contracts, participating in conferences or trade shows, and short-term training. 
* **Tourism (B2):** Sightseeing, vacationing, visiting friends and family, attending cultural or social events. 
* **Medical Treatment:** Seeking specialized medical care in the U.S. is also permitted under the B2 category. 
* **Short-term study (non-degree):** Certain recreational classes or workshops are allowed, provided they are not part of a degree program. 

These activities are considered temporary and non-immigrant in nature, which means they align with the purpose of the B1/B2 visa. 

### **What You Cannot Do with a B1/B2 Visa** 

While the visa allows for multiple activities, there are **strict limitations** you must respect: 

* **No Employment:** You cannot work for a U.S. employer or receive salary inside the United States. 
* **No Long-term Study:** Enrollment in a degree program or full-time education is prohibited. 
* **No Residency:** A B1/B2 visa does not provide a path to permanent residency or long-term stay. 
* **No Unauthorized Business:** You cannot set up or actively manage a U.S. business while on this visa. 

Violating these restrictions can lead to serious immigration consequences, including visa revocation or future entry bans. 

#### **Why Legal Guidance Matters** 

Immigration rules are detailed and sometimes confusing. Many travelers unintentionally overstep their visa limits, which may affect future applications. At **[Capitol Law Partners](https://capitollawpartners.com/)**, our attorneys provide **personalized guidance** to help you maximize the opportunities of your B1/B2 visa while staying compliant with U.S. immigration law.

 **U.S. Visas – Immigrant Visa Process: A Step-by-Step Guide** 

**1. Submit the Petition** 

You can begin the process by submitting a petition to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), either electronically or by mail. 

 

**2. NVC Processing (National Visa Center)** 

Once your petition is approved by USCIS, your case is forwarded to the U.S. Department of State’s National Visa Center (NVC) for pre-processing. 

You will receive a **Welcome Letter** via email or mail once your case is entered into the NVC system. This letter contains instructions and login credentials for the **Consular Electronic Application Center (CEAC)** where you can monitor your case, communicate with the NVC, and submit required documents. 

After paying the necessary fees and submitting all required forms and supporting documents, the NVC will review your case to ensure it is complete for interview scheduling. The interview appointment depends on availability at the respective U.S. Embassy or Consulate. 

Please note: Some immigrant visa categories are subject to annual numerical limits. Even if USCIS approves your petition, a visa number may not be immediately available. 

You can track the availability of visa numbers through the **Visa Bulletin**, published monthly by the U.S. Department of State. 

 

**3. Pay the Required Fees** 

After receiving your Welcome Letter, your first step is to pay the associated fees: 

* Immigrant Visa Application Processing Fee 
* Affidavit of Support Fee (if applicable) 

These fees must be paid **separately**; the online system does not allow them to be paid simultaneously. 

You will need a U.S. bank routing number and checking or savings account number to complete payment. 

After submitting your payments online, allow up to **10 calendar days** for NVC to process the fees before proceeding to the next step. 

 

**4. Submit Affidavit of Support – Form I-864** 

The **Affidavit of Support (Form I-864)** is a legally binding document in which a sponsor accepts financial responsibility for the intending immigrant. 

The petitioner must usually complete this form. If the petitioner's income is insufficient, a joint sponsor may also submit an I-864 form. 

This obligation typically lasts until the beneficiary becomes a U.S. citizen or has worked 40 quarters (approximately 10 years) under the Social Security Act. 

Failure to submit the correct form or supporting documentation can delay your case. 

The sponsor must: 

* Complete Form I-864 
* Submit proof of income and supporting financial documents 

If you are not required to submit Form I-864, you must contact the NVC before paying the Affidavit of Support fee and explain why. 

 

**5. Gather Civil and Supporting Documents** 

Once your fees are marked as **PAID** in CEAC and you complete the **DS-260 Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration Application**, you and each family member immigrating with you must gather all required civil documents. 

These documents must be issued by the official authorities in your country of residence. 

If documents are not in English or the official language of the country where the interview will take place, you must include certified translations. 

Each translation must include: 

* A signed statement from the translator 
* Certification that the translation is accurate and the translator is competent 

 

**6. Scan and Upload Your Documents** 

After collecting your documents, scan and upload them via CEAC. 

***Equipment Needed*** 

You will need a computer with a scanner or an internet-connected smartphone. If you lack access, consider using public libraries, internet cafés, or community centers. 

Do not send physical documents to NVC unless specifically instructed. Doing so may delay your case or result in lost documents. 

***Scanning Guidelines*** 

\-Accepted file formats: **.pdf** (preferred), **.jpg**, or **.jpeg** 

\-File size must not exceed **4 MB** 

\-Multi-page documents like Form I-864 should be scanned as a **single file** 

\-Files must be clear, legible, in color, and correctly oriented 

\-Include front and back sides of any document that contains stamps, seals, or writing 

\-Include certified translations and originals in a single file 

\-Do not upload password-protected or compressed files 

 

**7. Wait for NVC Review** 

After uploading your documents, wait for the NVC to review your case. If any documents are missing or incorrect, you will be notified via CEAC. Once your case is "documentarily complete," it will be queued for an interview appointment. 

 

**8. Track Your Priority Date (If Applicable)** 

If your visa category is subject to an annual cap, your case will remain in queue until your **priority date** becomes current. 

You can find monthly updates in the **Visa Bulletin** and determine when your case is eligible for an interview. 

 

**9. Interview Preparation and Follow-up** 

***1. Schedule and Complete the Medical Examination*** 

Before your interview, you must schedule and complete a **medical examination** with an approved physician. You will not be issued a visa without it. 

***2. Register for Courier Services and Review Instructions*** 

Some embassies require applicants to register for **courier delivery services** in advance. Check the embassy's website and CEAC for specific instructions. 

***3. Gather Interview Documents*** 

Every applicant, regardless of age, must bring the following to the interview: 

\-Passport 

\-2 passport-style photos 

\-DS-260 confirmation page 

\-Appointment letter 

\-Originals or certified copies of all civil documents submitted to the NVC 

*Do not bring your I-864 or financial documents unless specifically instructed.* 

**Police Certificate Validity** 

Review the expiration of your police certificates. You must obtain a new one if: 

* You turned 16 since your case became documentarily complete 
* The previously submitted certificate has expired or will expire before the interview 

Police certificates are valid for **two years** from the date of issue. 
 **Do not send updated police certificates to NVC** – just bring them to the interview.
